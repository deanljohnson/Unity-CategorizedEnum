# Unity-CategorizedEnum
Unity editor extension for categorized enum drop-downs.

Unity-CategorizedEnum is a simple editor extension to enable categorized enum drop-downs in the inspector. Categories can be specified using attributes, arbitrary functions, or auto-generated based on the naming of the enum members. The extension is easy to integrate into existing projects and comes with plenty of examples (which can be easily removed if you don't want them cluttering your project).
